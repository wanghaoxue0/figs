Description: Fast Interpretable Greedy-Tree Sums (FIGS) is an algorithm for fitting concise rule-based models.
    Specifically, FIGS generalizes CART to simultaneously grow a flexible number of trees in a summation.
    The total number of splits across all the trees can be restricted by a pre-specified threshold, keeping the model interpretable.
    Experiments across real-world datasets show that FIGS achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance when restricted to just a few splits (e.g. less than 20).
    'FIGS' is first defined in Tan et al. (2022) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11931>
