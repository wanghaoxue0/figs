\arguments{
\item{X}{the design matrix}

\item{y}{the response vector}

\item{max_rules}{max total number of rules across all trees}

\item{feature_names}{the name of features in the data}

\item{verbose}{bool value, if TRUE print the split feature and threshold}

\item{sample_weight}{allocate weight for each individual sampe, array-like of shape n (default=None). If None, then samples are equally weighted.}

\item{min_impurity_decrease}{A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value.}

\item{max_features}{the number of features to consider when looking for the best split}
}
